# 2D LOCATION OF SIGNALS SOURCE BY POLE-POLAR GEOMETRICY MODELS
## USER’S MANUAL

To develop this work we have built a simulator in MatLab code and used the implemented functions to construct a prototype that processes real data. All code and data used are at anyone’s disposal. We use MatLab releases 2009 and 2014 and problems were not reported

### 1)	First step: unzip the file GeometricModels.rar. Four new folders will be created: PPC&CHC, PLI, TLI&MAI and Experiments.

The geometric models “Pole-Polar Centroid” (PPC) and “Convex-Hull Centroid” (CHC) are in the folder PPC&CHC. The geometric models “Polar Lines Intersections” (PLI) is in the folder PLI and the models “Tangent Lines Intersections” and “Tangent Lines with Minimal Angles” are in the folder TLI&MAI. The folder Experiments contain the code and data for real case experiment and its analysis.

## DATA ENTRY PROCEDURE
The main window of the simulator, for any geometric model, is the data entry interface

The control of the data entry using this interface is done only with the mouse (click-move-click)

To set a position of a receiver, move the mouse pointer to the desired coordinate and press (first click) any mouse button. A big black point is plotted in this coordinate.
To determine the radial distance (receiver range), move the mouse pointer to the desired coordinate and press (second click) any mouse button. A blue circle line is drawn in this coordinate
Repeat the procedure above for each receiver used by the location system.
