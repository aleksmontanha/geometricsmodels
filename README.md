# 2D LOCATION OF SIGNALS SOURCE BY POLE-POLAR GEOMETRICY MODELS
## USER’S MANUAL

To develop this work we have built a simulator in MatLab code and used the implemented functions to construct a prototype that processes real data. All code and data used are at anyone’s disposal. We use MatLab releases 2009 and 2014 and problems were not reported

### 1)	First step: unzip the file GeometricModels.rar. Four new folders will be created: PPC&CHC, PLI, TLI&MAI and Experiments.

The geometric models “Pole-Polar Centroid” (PPC) and “Convex-Hull Centroid” (CHC) are in the folder PPC&CHC. The geometric models “Polar Lines Intersections” (PLI) is in the folder PLI and the models “Tangent Lines Intersections” and “Tangent Lines with Minimal Angles” are in the folder TLI&MAI. The folder Experiments contain the code and data for real case experiment and its analysis.

## DATA ENTRY PROCEDURE
The main window of the simulator, for any geometric model, is the data entry interface
